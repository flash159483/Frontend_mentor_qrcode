- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

The most difficult part of this project was to get the right size and align the div in the middle of the website
So through this website I learned how to do those

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-size: 15px;
}

.container {
    width: 19rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 0.8rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
}

```

### Continued development

I could use this when I want to add qr code inside of my website
